     You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend:
     Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -,
     you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "â€“".
     The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.
     Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

     Input : String s = "++++"
     Output : [ "--++", "+--+", "++--"]

     --------------Algorithm-----------------
     1- Going through the string and finding every single place where we have 2 consecutive ++ signs.
     2- Flipping them to -- sign and count for next possible move by iterating it over next characters.
     3- Create a list of string called possibleStates
     4- initialize the index with start from i = 0 till length of string
     5- We also need to make sure when we iterate the string next time we shouldn't be counting the first occurrences of ++ signs we encountered
     6- So, we keep on updating the nextMoves
     7- If index can never find 2 consecutives ++ then nextMoves becomes -1 which means we should return empty list
     8- If not then we could make String of nextStates with possible moves and add it to our list of results.

     ---------Time complexity would be O(n*n) due to substring call and space complexity is O(n)-----------------
